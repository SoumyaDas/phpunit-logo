# PHPUnit Logo Suggestions

During the PHPUnit Code Sprint in Hamburg we came up with the task of finding a (new) logo for PHPUnit. This repository holds ideas, sketches and suggestions for now.

## General approach

- it should be flat
- we like the idea of having separate colors for "PHP" and "Unit"
- ideally the logo would contain a reference to code coverage, successfully run tests or similar

## Suggestions

Colors are somewhat off, but I like the checkmark as a sign for a successful test run. The font is Avenir Next Condensed.

One line, the `[x]` is a reference to a passed test with testdox output enabled.

The font is Nunito, and the colors are _the PHP color_ as well as the according non-saturated (i.e., monochromatic) variant.
